# SWP-Python
The ultra legendary Python Repository with the best Professor.

## How to use it?
Feel free to copy my homework, when its useful for you.

Python is a cool language to use. There are many cool feature who are able to simpliefy your programming mood.
A Second feature is the giant libary, never seen so many packaged by nativ.

## Chapter One

### Algorithms 2 Go

We have here three sort algorithms, maybe u recognize them from last year, nothing special about.
I also wrote into the code why the in-build list-sort() is better than coding your own.

### Linked List

Now one of the most basic concepts in programming is the linked list. In Python itself the concept is rather useless, but its a great programming exercise to understand the concept of pointers.

The class Node is the basic element of the linked list. It has a value ( actually not needed but its common) and a pointer to the next element. In our example its the *next* value.
The linked list class has a value *head* and some optional methodes to add or remove elements.
Now the first (HEAD) Node will be our starting point and referes with the *next* value to the next Node. This goes on until the last Node has no next value.
